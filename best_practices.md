# Programming Best Practices

## Start-up phase
* Always discuss purpose and general strategy before starting a project.
* Always make wireframes.
* If you know you're going to need some big complex tech (like a new JS library or a complex-to-use gem), study it independently first.
* Set up Guard and always keep it running.

## Development phase
* To the greatest extent feasible, practice TDD. The most obvious tests will suggest themselves, but when you get to a stopping place (e.g., when you're going to do a push), add less obvious tests as well.
* Develop controllers, test data, and tests before designing views.
* Document everything:
  * Always put one or two lines (at least) before every method, explaining what it does.
  * Take special care to note anything unusual.
  * If you forget to do this, go back afterward and add it in.
* Make SuperMemo questions about any new methods, commands, tools, concepts, etc. you learn *as you develop* (not afterward; but if you must, then go ahead do it afterward).
