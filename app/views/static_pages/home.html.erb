    <h1>GreaterWiki</h1>
    <p>GreaterWiki will be an open, worldwide, participatory project to collect 
    and rate the best encyclopedia articles on the Internet on every topicâ€”and 
    to encourage even more.</p>

    <p>There is a critical need for GreaterWiki.</p>
    
    <p>Wikipedia has given up the responsibility of organizing expert knowledge, 
    and Google's algorithms rank pages based on popularity rather than 
    credibility. There is no easy way to find the most reliable information 
    online.</p>
    
    <p>Imagine if the world's smart people came together to share their best 
    explanations of everything, linked from one place, and ranked by the 
    community in each topic. We desperately need a free marketplace of 
    encyclopedic information, not dominated by any one, biased group, but open 
    to many competing groups, each with its own set of independent ratings.</p>
    
    <p>That's what we're building: an open directory of the best of our 
    knowledge.</p>
