    <p class="question">When will this website be ready?</p>
    <p class="answer">We might have a decent first draft by early
    2018.</p>

    <p class="question">Why aren't there any ideas on the site yet?</p>
    <p class="answer">Because Larry hasn't finished going through Hartl's
    Rails tutorial yet. Soon!</p>

    <p class="question">Well, what the heck <em>can</em> I do on this site?</p>
    <p class="answer">You can actually <%= link_to "sign up", signup_path %> and
      activate your account and everything! Whoa nelly!</p>

  </section>
  <div class="login_button center">
    <%= link_to "Join!", signup_path, class: "btn btn-lg btn-primary" %>
